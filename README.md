# grid_optimizations
Program designed to optimize grid based analysis

Primarily based on 2D analysis of systems. As an example if we wanted to find distance between all points of two or more vectors, this program could be used to discretize the process, and make it more efficient. 

Another example (and the one that brought up the need for this program) is finding Minimum Distances from v1 (the domain vector) with shape (n,2) to v2 (m,2).
